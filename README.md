Tictactoe Mind Game Developed Using Minimax AI Algorithm in Java
Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (Commonwealth English), or Xs and Os (Irish English) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.

<h4 align="left">GAMEPLAY</h4>
Tic-tac-toe is played on a three-by-three grid by two players, who alternately place the marks X and O in one of the nine spaces in the grid.<br>
There is no universally-agreed rule as to who plays first, but the convention that X plays first is used.<br>
Because of the simplicity of tic-tac-toe, it is often used as a pedagogical tool for teaching the concepts of good sportsmanship and the branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the searching of game trees.<br>

A player can play a perfect game of tic-tac-toe (to win or at least draw) if, each time it is their turn to play, they choose the first available move from the following list, as used in Newell and Simon's 1972 tic-tac-toe program.<br>

<b>Win:</b> If the player has two in a row, they can place a third to get three in a row.<br>
<b>Block:</b> If the opponent has two in a row, the player must play the third themselves to block the opponent.<br>
<b>Fork:</b> Cause a scenario where the player has two ways to win (two non-blocked lines of 2).<br>
<b>Blocking an opponent's fork:</b> If there is only one possible fork for the opponent, the player should block it. Otherwise, the player should block all forks in any way that simultaneously allows them to make two in a row. Otherwise, the player should make a two in a row to force the opponent into defending, as long as it does not result in them producing a fork. For example, if "X" has two opposite corners and "O" has the center, "O" must not play a corner move to win. (Playing a corner move in this scenario produces a fork for "X" to win.)<br>
<b>Center:</b> A player marks the center. (If it is the first move of the game, playing a corner move gives the second player more opportunities to make a mistake and may therefore be the better choice; however, it makes no difference between perfect players.)<br>
<b>Opposite corner:</b> If the opponent is in the corner, the player plays the opposite corner.<br>
<b>Empty corner:</b> The player plays in a corner square.<br>
<b>Empty side:</b> The player plays in a middle square on any of the four sides.<br>
